# How to use
Download the .zip and extract
All the midi files should be in the same directory as the "main.cpp" file
To compile it do these commands from the root directory
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
To run it do
```
./main
```
in the build folder

Tested with external MIDI synth ONLY.
